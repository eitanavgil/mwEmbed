For full un-minified source see  http://www.kaltura.org/project/HTML5_Video_Media_JavaScript_Library  

To use the library include the following javascript:

In the head of your page you will need jQuery and the mwEmbed-player package:

<!-- If your page already includes jQuery you can skip this step -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="kaltura-html5player-widget/jquery-1.4.2.min.js" ></scirpt>

<!-- Include the css and javascript  -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="kaltura-html5player-widget/mwEmbed-player-static.css"></link> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="kaltura-html5player-widget/mwEmbed-player-static.js" ></scirpt>

...
Now in your HTML you can use the video tag and it will be given a user interface ie: 

<video poster="myPoster.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px" durationHint="32.2" >
    <source src="myOgg.ogg" />
    <source src="myH.264.mp4" />
</video>



== Notes on Optimization == 

mwEmbed is designed to be used with a script-loader and this static package sacrifices
transport size and packages in code every client won't use, in order to be a single static file. 
You can learn more about using mwEmbed with a script-loader on the project home page. Also if
you remote include the kaltura code it works with the only-what-you-need loader system ie: 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://html5.kaltura.org/js" > </script>

We may include some of these techniques in future versions of the static gadget.
